Beanstalkd can be accessed via port 11300 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
{{ template "beanstalkd.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local

If you'd like to test your instance, forward the port locally:

  export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l "app={{ template "beanstalkd.fullname" . }}" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
  kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 11300

In another tab, attempt to get stats:

  $ echo -e 'stats\r\n' | nc localhost 11300

You should see (something like):

  OK 898
